# SQL Security Configuration for Teradata MCP Server

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Mandatory SQL Validation
- **NO BYPASS OPTION**: Removed the `DISABLE_SQL_VALIDATION` environment variable bypass
- **Comprehensive Pattern Matching**: Enhanced regex patterns to catch all variations of dangerous operations
- **Mandatory Logging**: All SQL queries are logged for security audit trails

### 2. Blocked Operations
The following SQL operations are **strictly prohibited**:
- `DELETE` - Data deletion
- `UPDATE` - Data modification  
- `INSERT` - Data insertion
- `DROP` - Object deletion
- `CREATE` - Object creation
- `ALTER` - Object modification
- `TRUNCATE` - Table truncation
- `MERGE` - Data merging
- `REPLACE` - Data replacement
- `UPSERT` - Insert or update
- `GRANT` - Permission granting
- `REVOKE` - Permission revocation
- `CALL` - Procedure execution
- `EXECUTE` - Dynamic execution

### 3. Multiple Security Layers

#### Layer 1: Enhanced validate_sql() Function
- Comprehensive keyword detection
- Multiple regex patterns to prevent bypass attempts
- Suspicious pattern detection (obfuscation attempts)
- SQL injection pattern detection
- Mandatory security logging

#### Layer 2: Function-Level Validation
- Secondary check in `handle_base_readQuery()` functions
- Ensures only SELECT and WITH statements are allowed
- Additional logging for security violations

### 4. Pattern Detection
The system detects and blocks:
- Basic keyword patterns (`DELETE FROM`, `UPDATE SET`, etc.)
- Keywords after semicolons (statement stacking)
- Keywords in parentheses
- Keywords after comments
- Obfuscation attempts using CHAR(), CHR(), CONCAT()
- SQL injection patterns (UNION SELECT, comment injection)

### 5. Security Logging
All security events are logged:
- All SQL queries submitted for validation
- Blocked dangerous operations with details
- Suspicious pattern detections
- Security violations with query snippets

### 6. Read-Only Enforcement
- Only SELECT and WITH statements are permitted
- CTE (Common Table Expressions) are allowed for complex queries
- All data modification operations are blocked at multiple levels

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators:
1. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review security logs for blocked attempts
2. **Audit Access**: Ensure only authorized users have access to the system
3. **Network Security**: Implement proper network-level access controls
4. **Database Permissions**: Use database-level permissions as additional protection

### For Users:
1. **Read-Only Operations**: Use only SELECT statements for data retrieval
2. **Proper Queries**: Write efficient queries with WHERE clauses
3. **Error Handling**: Understand that security errors indicate policy violations

## Emergency Procedures

If legitimate data modification is required:
1. **Use Direct Database Access**: Connect directly to Teradata outside of MCP
2. **Administrative Tools**: Use dedicated admin tools for schema changes
3. **Controlled Environment**: Perform modifications in controlled environments only

## Testing

Run the security test suite to verify all protections are working:
```bash
python test_sql_security.py
```

This test validates that:
- All dangerous operations are blocked
- Safe SELECT operations are allowed
- Multiple bypass attempts are prevented

## Compliance

This configuration ensures:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only read operations are permitted
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against bypass attempts
- **Audit Trail**: All activities are logged for compliance and investigation
- **Zero Trust**: No operations are trusted without validation
